# Are Transformers the Best Choice For Time Series Forecasting?
Project realized for the Statistical Learning course in the Data Science master's degree, University of Rome "La Sapienza".   

In our project we want to compare the performance of various models, from the simplest to the most advanced, to conduct Long Time Series Forecasting.
We want to answer the following questions:
• How well Transformers are able to solve this kind of problem?
• Is it really necessary to bother the Transforms to do LTSF?
• How is their performance compared to that achieved by more simpler models?
